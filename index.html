    <h1> What Is ARC?</h1>
    <p> Our project is an Augmented Reality Collaborative experience, built for the purpose of encouraging/incentivizing increased social interaction and community contribution through team-building games and experiences.

Players will be tasked with finding both virtual and tangible objects, and sometimes asked to compete in cooperative challenges to successfully check an item off the list (obstacle course, race, etc.).
        Players would be able to increase in rank/levels, earn collectibles.
